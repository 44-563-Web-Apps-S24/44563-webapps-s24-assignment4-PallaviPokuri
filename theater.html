    <h1>Pallavi Pokuri does Chekov tonight</h1>
    <h2>Ivanoff by Anton Chekov</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>ZINAIDA.</h3>
        <p></p> Why do you bring the tea in like that? Go and fetch some jam to eat with it!</p>
        
        <h3>MARTHA.</h3>
        <p>No thank you; none for me, don't trouble yourself.</p>
        <p>[A pause.]</p>
        
        <h3>FIRST GUEST.</h3>
        <p>[To MARTHA] Did you come through Mushkine on your way here?</p>
        
        <h3>MARTHA.</h3>
        <p>No, I came by way of Spassk. The road is better that way.</p>
        
        <h3>FIRST GUEST.</h3>
        <p>Yes, so it is.</p>
        
        <h3>KOSICH.</h3>
        <p>Two in spades.</p>
        
        <h3>GEORGE.</h3>
        <p>Pass.</p>
        
        <h3>AVDOTIA.</h3>
        <p>Pass.</p>
        
        <h3>SECOND GUEST.</h3>
        <p>Pass.</p>
        
        <h3>MARTHA.</h3>
        <p>The price of lottery tickets has gone up again, my dear. I have never known such a state of affairs. The first issue is already worth two hundred and seventy and the second nearly two hundred and fifty. This has never happened before.</p>
        
        <h3>ZINAIDA.</h3>
        <p>How fortunate for those who have a great many tickets!</p>
        
        <h3>MARTHA.</h3>
        <p>Don't say that, dear; even when the price of tickets is high it does not pay to put one's capital into them.</p>
