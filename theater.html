            <p class="speech">Why do you bring the tea in like that? Go and fetch some jam to eat with it!</p>

            <h3 class="name">MARTHA.</h3>
            <p class="speech">No thank you; none for me, don't trouble yourself.</p>
            <p class="direction">[A pause.]</p>

            <h3 class="name">FIRST GUEST.</h3>
            <p class="speech">[To MARTHA] Did you come through Mushkine on your way here?</p>

            <h3 class="name">MARTHA.</h3>
            <p class="speech">No, I came by way of Spassk. The road is better that way.</p>

            <h3 class="name">FIRST GUEST.</h3>
            <p class="speech">Yes, so it is.</p>

            <h3 class="name">KOSICH.</h3>
            <p class="speech">Two in spades.</p>

            <h3 class="name">GEORGE.</h3>
            <p class="speech">Pass.</p>

            <h3 class="name">AVDOTIA.</h3>

            <h3 class="name">SECOND GUEST.</h3>
            <p class="speech">Pass.</p>

            <h3 class="name">MARTHA.</h3>
            <p class="speech">The price of lottery tickets has gone up again, my dear. I have never known such a state of affairs. The first issue is already worth two hundred and seventy and the second nearly two hundred and fifty. This has never happened before.</p>

            <h3 class="name">ZINAIDA.</h3>
            <p class="speech">How fortunate for those who have a great many tickets!</p>

            <h3 class="name">MARTHA.</h3>
            <p class="speech">Don't say that, dear; even when the price of tickets is high it does not pay to put one's capital into them.</p>
