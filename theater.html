            <p>ZINAIDA. Why do you bring the tea in like that? Go and fetch some jam to eat with it!</p>
            <p>MARTHA. No thank you; none for me, don't trouble yourself. [A pause.]</p>
            <p>FIRST GUEST. [To MARTHA] Did you come through Mushkine on your way here?</p>
            <p>MARTHA. No, I came by way of Spassk. The road is better that way.</p>
            <p>FIRST GUEST. Yes, so it is.</p>
            <p>KOSICH. Two in spades.</p>
            <p>GEORGE. Pass.</p>
            <p>AVDOTIA. Pass.</p>
            <p>SECOND GUEST. Pass.</p>
            <p>MARTHA. The price of lottery tickets has gone up again, my dear. I have never known such a state of affairs. The first issue is already worth two hundred and seventy and the second nearly two hundred and fifty. This has never happened before.</p>
            <p>ZINAIDA. How fortunate for those who have a great many tickets!</p>
            <p>MARTHA. Don't say that, dear; even when the price of tickets is high it does not pay to put one's capital into them.</p>
